### About me
***

I am Ravi Mandalia, currently working as a Software Engineer at an MNC with a total experience of 3+ years where I have worked on Java, SpringBoot, AWS.

Apart from tech, I have been into sports from childhood. From taking part in School annual sports to playing inter-college Cricket Tournament. I love playing Cricket and Badminton. I love playing video games and watch different kind of sports in my free time.

I enjoy reading articles on personal development & financial literacy. I usually read blogs or watch YouTube videos about the same.

I enjoy my time when I'm travelling and discover new places and talking to the locals. I recently went to Goa, Rajasthan(2022) with my friends but I'm planning a solo trip soon. ;)
